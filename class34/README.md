# Class 33 - Context API

## 1. Why is the Context API useful?

- useMemo can help the performance of an application by “remembering” expensive functions and preventing a re-render every time there is a change in the application. [Resource](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-usememo)

- useReducer is great for managing more complicated state than you would want to manage with useState on its own. [Resource](https://daveceddia.com/usereducer-hook-examples/)

## 2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
React requires this because it warns you when attempting to use custom hooks in unintended ways.

## 3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
Custom Hooks provide you with reusuable functionality that you can use in multiple areas of your application.

## 4. Describe “Context Hell”

React-use seems pretty useful. It allows you to keep track of screen size, motion, animations, and dynamically adjust CSS.
