# Class 14 - Message Queues

## 1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

[Resource](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/amazon-sqs-introduces-fifo-queues-with-exactly-once-processing-and-lower-prices-for-standard-queues/#:~:text=FIFO%20queues%20have%20essentially%20the,being%20received%20by%20message%20consumers.)

FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers

## 2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

Logging message delivery status helps provide better operational insight, such as the following:

-Knowing whether a message was delivered to the Amazon SNS endpoint.

-Identifying the response sent from the Amazon SNS endpoint to Amazon SNS.

-Determining the message dwell time (the time between the publish timestamp and just before handing off to an Amazon SNS endpoint).

## 3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

[Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)

The Observer Pattern

## 4. How do you test an event driven system?

[Resource](https://blog.gurock.com/event-driven-application-architectures/)

Creating unit tests for asynchronous functions requires a different approach to test design. In an asynchronous environment, calls happen in response to a message. The message needs to be published to a message queue, pulled by a service and then processed. Then the result needs to be published to yet another queue to an interested party. 


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **FIFO Queue** - FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing.

- **Pub/Sub** - Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.  [Resource](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)
