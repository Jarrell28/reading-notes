# Class 11 - Event Driven Applications

## 1. Why is access control important?

Access control allows you to control your application by restricting certain functionality from users. This is important because non-admin users should not be capable of performing the same actions as admin users. 


## 2. Describe an application that would need access control.

E-commerce, social media applications, almost any application that would allow users to create an account needs to have some level of access control.

## 3. What is a role used for?

A role is used to assign users to a specific group. The role comes with permissions that allow users in that role to perform certain actions in an application. 

## 4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

RBAC seems easier to implement in an environment and easier to manage than discretionary and mandatory access control. With Discretionary Access Control, users would manually allow other users to access files that they. With Mandatory Access Control system administrators have to set up the each user's computer with a specific level of access. Both DAC and MAC contain manually labor to achieve access control which is more time consuming than RBAC.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **Authorization** - Allows you to access certain parts of an application based on your access level

- **Role Based Access Control** - Access is assigned to users based on their role in the application.

- **Capabilities** - Capabilities are the permissions in the application that are assigned to roles.
