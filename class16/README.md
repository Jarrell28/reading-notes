# Class 16 - AWS: Cloud Server

## 1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

This is the cycle in which a client receives resources from a server. The client makes an http request to a server, the server receives the http request. The server identifies if the resource requested is available, then sends a response with the resource back to the client.

## 2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

A server is anything that receives http requests and sends responses.

## 3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

Deploying an application means to take the application files and host them on a live server for people to access.
