##  Common Mistakes 

The most severe mistake a programmer can make in a whiteboard interview is improper allocation of time. When receiving a problem during an interview, do not rush to start writing code as soon as possible. Take the time to make sure you completely understand the problem before attempting to solve it. 


## Simple Set of Steps

1.Read the problem completely twice.

2.Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

3.Optimize the manual steps.

4.Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

5.Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

6.Optimize the real code.

**As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.**



## Read the problem completely twice

***This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.***

You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.


## Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data

***Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!***

Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around. I recommend that you solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.

## Optimize the manual solution

People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct an idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

## Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code

What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.

## Replace comments with real code

This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

-You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps

-You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

If you didn’t break the problem down enough, try going back to the second step and being as meticulous as possible.  Write out each and every single step.  I know it is a pain, but do it, believe me it will be worth the effort.

If you don’t know your programming language well enough to do the translation, you may need to brush up here on some basic constructs.  Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:

## Optimize the real code

Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names. 


## [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

> “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -
Niklas Göke

You have very few hours here on on this earth.Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth. Many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.

**Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000**

* How would that change you? Your life? Your family? Your future?

* What problems would you stop wasting time on?

* What people would you stop putting up with?

Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

## Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy

> “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss

Most people prize “being busy.” They proclaim it with pride, as if it’s a badge of honor.But for most people, this “busyness” is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters. They just like feeling busy.For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters. Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time.

*“Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”*

**If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.**

## You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them

> “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet

You probably need to say “no” more. Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things. Those few things determine their career, legacy, and livelihood.

Warren Buffet, investor extraordinaire and a net worth of over $70 billion dollars, has said that for every hundred opportunities he is given, he might say yes to 1–2 of them. Really successful people say no to most things, because most things won’t get them to where they truly want to be.

Steve Jobs also shared this mentality. Decades ago, Jobs was quoted:

> “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”

This process of weeding out the merely “good” for the truly great opportunities is easier when you value your time at $1,000/hour. Anything you can honestly justify doing for $1,000/hour is probably a good thing.

**Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.**

**Problem solving is the meta-skill**

## 1. Understand

- Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).
- How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

> “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman


## 2. Plan 

- Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
- Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.
- This means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

## 3. Divide

- Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
- Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).
- After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
- Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
- Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

## Practice!

**Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!**

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”
  
## [5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

The 5 Whys technique is a simple but powerful tool for cutting quickly through the outward symptoms of a problem to reveal its underlying causes, so that you can deal with it once and for all. You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

1. **Assemble a Team** - Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.
2. **Define the Problem** - If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.
3. **Ask the First "Why?"** - Ask your team why the problem is occurring.Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
4. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times** - For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
5. **Know When to Stop** - You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident.
