# Reading Notes

# Class 17 - AWS: S3 and Lambda

## 1. Describe “The Cloud”

"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

## 2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [Resource](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

## 3. What is auto-scaling?

A method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm. [Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling)

## 4. What is bandwidth?

Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth,[1] data bandwidth,[2] or digital bandwidth. [Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))

## 5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?

-They bill based on usage

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **Server Instances** - An instance is a virtual server in the AWS cloud. With Amazon EC2, you can set up and configure the operating system and applications that run on your instance. [Resouse](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)

- **Containers** - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [Resource](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

- **Cloud Services** - The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. [Resource](https://www.citrix.com/glossary/what-is-a-cloud-service.html)

- **Cloud Architecture** - Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. [Resource](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/cloud-architecture)

- **AWS** - Amazon Web Services offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services.

- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku** - 
**EC2/Beanstalk is recommended if:** 
- You need infrastructure flexibility from the first deployment of your application.

- You can afford a DevOps engineer or several DevOps engineers to manage the infrastructure.

- You’re ready to spend more time deploying new versions of your app.

- Your project demands great computational resources.

**Heroku is recommended if:**

- You need to deploy and test a Minimum Viable Product.

- You need to improve your application quickly after getting feedback from users.

- You can’t afford a DevOps engineer (or engineers).

- Your project doesn’t demand that many computational resources.
