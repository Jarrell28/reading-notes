# Class 28 - Component Composition

## 1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?

A deployed react application does not require a server because it gets compiled into static html and js files.

## 2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?
We test the behavior of the app instead of unit testing because React is a view library which means the UI will constantly change. It would take an extremely large time to write unit tests for every UI change we make, so we instead only focus on the behavior

## 3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

Converts a React application into static html, css, and js files

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- **component props** - Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a synthesis and refinement of practices stemming from Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD).[Resource](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'bdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))

- **component state** - An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario.  [Resource](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/acceptance/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'acceptance*20test))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))

- **application state** - Mounting is the process of outputting the virtual representation of a component into the final UI representation (e.g. DOM or Native Components).
